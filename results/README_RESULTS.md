# Experimental Results

This folder will contain the analysis outputs, visualizations, and model performance metrics from the neural spike simulation experiments.

The experiments are currently in progress â€” results (figures, spike raster plots, Bayesian inference metrics, etc.) will be uploaded once data collection and model validation are complete.

Expected update: **Late October 2025**

Thank you for your interest and patience!
